# Rules

## Time

Game has two units of time:

1. TICK = `0.033 seconds * SPEED_OF_GAME (default 1)`
2. TURN = `10 * TICK`

On every tick monsters (tanks & bullets) can move to specific direction.

On every turn tanks can any action (like rotate or shot),
but tank can make one action per turn (so is not possible to shot on every tick)


## Possible actions of tanks
Protocol of actions are described [here](./actions.md)
